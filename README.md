# holidaygift
I like to do cute surprises for friends around the holidays. For 2023, I decided to make a customized holiday gift website, which can provide customized message for predefined recipients as well as distribute preconfigured Steam game redeemable codes. Realistically, this also ended up as a fun testbed example single-page Next.js webapp.

## Local development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
